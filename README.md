# Photo-Reconstruction-Deep-Learning-Course-Project
• Designed a system with the capability to restore and reconstruct missing portions of image for the purpose of image recovery\
• Developed a Bi-LSTM-based model that effectively filled square holes in masked images, achieving a RMSE score of 0.17322\
• Improved the RMSE score by using Context Encoder model of 7 sequential convolutional layers in both encoder and decoder\
• Trained the model on dataset of 14,000 images and fine-tuned the hyperparameters to achieve a RMSE score of 0.17101\
